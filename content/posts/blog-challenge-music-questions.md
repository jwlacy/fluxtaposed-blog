Yep… It happened. I got tagged in one of the various blog challenges! How dare [Jason](https://cool-as-heck.blog/) force me to actually write something here!

### What are five of your favourite albums?

-

**Mae - The Everglow**

They say music can be a connection to a certain point in our lives. Discovered the album and artist during my early 20’s during my first time living on my own in my first apartment. Just really connected to the emotions. Saw them perform in concert too which just made it extra special. Total emo vibes bro.

-

**The Foo Fighters - The Colour and the Shape**

Just amazing song that I remember listening to over and over and over in my youth.

-

**All Time Low - Put Up or Shut Up (EP)**

Again, soundtrack to my early 20’s and cemented my love for the band and the pop-punk goodness they created.

-

**The Smashing Pumpkins - Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness**

A landmark album of the 90’s. A was definitely influenced by a friend when the Pumpkins & Green Day were some of the first rock artists I really dove into, but what isn’t to love about the 90’s alt scene? Nirvana, Soundgarden, STP…. SO MANY.

-

**Goldfinger (self titled)**

The first parental advisory CD I owned. Badass ska punk.

### What are five of your favourite songs?

-

**A Favor House Atlantic** - Coheed & Cambria

-

**Helix Nebula** - Anamanaguchi

-

**We’re on Top of the World** - Juliana Theory

-

**Endless Fantasy** - Anamanaguchi

-

**Kimbal** - Good Tiger

### Favourite instrument(s)?

-

bass (I’ve played for years!)

### What song or album are you currently listening to?

Whatever pops up in my Discover Weekly!

### Do you listen to the radio? If so, how often?

Not very often, only if in the car with others. When I’m commuting its either one of my own playlists or a podcast.

### How often do you listen to music?

Probably every day, between work, driving, end of night, or exercising.

### How often do you discover music? And how do you discover music?

I would say on a weekly basis thru Spotify either the DJ feature or my “Discover Weekly”. I probably can’t tell you the names of any of the artists though.

### What’s a song or album that you enjoy that you wish had more recognition?

Oh jeez, probably anything from Game Chops or the 8-bit Big Band. Sure, its VGM, but boy is there talent there.

### What’s your favourite song of all time?

Impossible to answer this.

### Has your taste in music evolved over the years?

1,000%

I think it has evolved for everyone! I wouldn’t say I’ve had phases more of just genre shifts over the years.

Rock - Jazz - Punk - Metal - Emo - Electronic (a huge variety)

Now I just listen to whatever sounds good to me and suits my mood. Which is apparently a ton of Synthwave, LoFi, and everything in between.
