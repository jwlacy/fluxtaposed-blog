Boy, you blink and time has just slipped thru your fingertips…

I haven’t had many things to say that I would deem “blog worthy”, which is probably what has kept me from posting here on a regular basis. What have I been doing? Devouring books. I’m on pace to shatter my goal of reading 30 for the year and will likely try for 40 in 2025. I’m also part of a Bookwyrm book club which has been to have a shared experience with.

Beyond horror and sci fi, I recently read “Play Nice” by Jason Schrier, which delves into the history of Blizzard Entertainment. If you were a pc gamer coming of age in the 90’s, you probably played one of their games. I fell in love with the world of Azeroth thanks to Warcraft II and would draw fan art of goblin sappers and death knights. This bled over to Starcraft, Warcraft III, and of course the World of Warcraft. Holy hell that game has been out for 20 years!

This was my introduction into the world of high fantasy, to the world of RTS, MMORPGs, and flirting with the idea to pursue game design. It’s not all good, there is plenty of the bad that came from this studio as well and it’s definitely not the hallmark that it once was… Did I reinstall WoW? Yes. Do I have the urge to play it? Also yes. Not sure how I will fit that into an already limited schedule and it’s like rose colored glasses here, but time will tell.

What else is happening? Slowly playing Echoes of Wisdom and tackling yet another horror novel. Trying to work out some recurring game nights with friends and giving a bit more time to myself and hobbies without feeling guilty about it. It’s a delicate tightrope to walk.

That’s all for now, hopefully I can write more soon.
