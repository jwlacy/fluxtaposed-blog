Haven’t had much to voice over the past few days.

Works been busy, had a mini vacation that work interrupted too much, and been trying to enjoy the nice weather we’ve had here in Michigan.

**Facts:**

Running outside is so much nicer than the treadmill.

I almost hit 6 miles on Sunday and it was awesome. I love being able to get lost in the journey, digest a podcast, and the whole experience feels effortless. Forgot to calibrate my watch though…. Want to try to get my pace down a bit, I’m targeting sub 10 min/mile for now.

Helldivers 2 is hella fun.

This has been my go-to game the past few weeks and has provided a platform to reconnect with some of gaming friends.

**FOR DEMOCRACY**

I miss craft beer.

Just the experience of it, the social aspect, and the conversation. I’m still going strong on my sober-curious journey (almost 6 months), but it’s been a bit of a reset. Athletic Brewing still is a wonderful substitute.

That’s all I’ve got right now, time to run off to meeting….
