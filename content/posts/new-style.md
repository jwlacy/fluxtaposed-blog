I'm in the mood for eliminating subscriptions I don't need this year.

I haven't had my own personal laptop in years, so I migrated to a MacBook Air just before EoY. I love it. Haven't had one since 2007-2008 and I like getting familiar with the ecosystem again. Plus, the sync between mobile and the laptop are amazing.

I've hosted this blog via pika-page since sunsetting the podcast, and I have zero complaints with their service. I just wanted $6/month back.
