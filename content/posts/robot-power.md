I’ve wanted to write about this for a while, but at the same time, apprehensive about sharing it.

I know, I know, these are my thoughts and my opinions. Who cares what anyone else thinks!?

While I’ve been using the fediverse (Mastodon) for not nearly as long as others, I’ve been able to pick up on a general theme. AI is shit, and I’m supposed to hate it. Or am I making an over-generalisation here? I am building workflows with it daily in my professional work, and it’s powerful.

Some caveats. I’m focusing on repetitive, mind-numbing, and mundane tasks across my company (third-party transportation provider), and finding ways to automate those workflows via a very powerful AI toolset. The AI bot ingests the commands/UI/API/screen recording it is given, and then I create a workflow for it to follow in execution. I’m able to create integrations between software suites that have no other interactivity, streamlining many processes along the way.

I’m currently developing a multi-branching, logic-driven flow that allows my back-office team a way to process/review invoices without direct effort on their part. This then gives that team back valuable bandwidth to use to focus on AR Collections or any escalations that arise. It’s been incredibly fulfilling. 

I also never bothered with Chatgpt or any other LLM. I have to do a lot of dumb stuff in Excel way more often than I’d like. Instead of banging my head against the wall when a formula breaks, I now plug it into an AI prompt and immediately gain a leg up in troubleshooting. (I’ve also used Kagi Assistant quite a bit.) I don’t know why I waited so long, because wow… What a difference.

I guess I just want to say that I’m very much not in the business of replacing people with technology, but moreso TURBO CHARGING their abilities with technology. I haven’t been able to automate a lot of my own direct work YET, but I hope to continue to evaluate that soon. I really just need to be able to help get this Commission Module out and running. That way I will no longer have to maintain “freak in the sheets (spreadsheets of course, duh)” status.

All this to say, I’m excited about my current career trajectory and love being the power user of an exciting technology. I’m involved with something meaningful on a regular basis, and part of a team that is rapidly evolving the way my company conducts work. We are on the forefront of a lot of trends in our specific industry, especially when relative to the size of our organization.

I’m doing cool shit with AI. I’m not afraid to say it.
