Last night, we streamed and recorded the final episode of our long-running podcast, “What the Fluxtaposed.”

Ten years of memories, bad jokes, and really….fun. We stayed true to our form this entire time, and I’m happy with the end results. Time to take a break from content creation for a bit and clear my head. Somewhere down the road, I might just have to dip my toes in again with a side project or two.

Thanks to everyone that listened all that time and supported our antics. It really is the fuel to keep things going for a creator.

Godspeed “What the Fluxtaposed”. But now, it is….the end.
