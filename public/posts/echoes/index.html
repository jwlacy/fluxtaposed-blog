    <p>I’m still waiting for a spark of motivation or creativity to really drive and inspire these pages. I did carve a pumpkin though….</p>
<p>I don’t play games nearly as often as I would like, but that has been a disguised blessing. I’m *eager *for news on the sequel to the Nintendo Switch. That little hybrid console has let me enjoy hours of games whether in front of a TV or not and it has been that flexibility that has made all of the difference. With reading being my primary hobby as of late, there have been tons of games coming out that I can enjoy at my leisure and digest slowly over time. All the hype for Xenoblade Chronicles X DE next year only reminds me that I need to get back to Xenoblade Chronicles 3! See where I’m going with this?</p>
<p>I’ve been tipping my toes back into Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom this week and that’s been rather, well, just a joy. It’s Zelda, yet it feels familiar and new simultaneously. It’s just a fun game to play and it’s been a great way to kill off time when I wake up at 4 am randomly and can’t fall back asleep. Sure, the menu system for finding and assigning the echo you want to use is not ideal BUT it’s a fun mix of the familiar 2D Zelda formula with new twists. Perhaps when I hit those end credits I’ll come back here with more full-picture thoughts, but here’s a little stream of them to get things started.</p>
<p>Tonight, I should be able to wrap up Leviathan Wakes. It’s been a hell of a “space story” and paints a full picture of the world the author has created. I’m not sure if I’ll jump into watching “The Expanse” anytime soon, but I like the book! For some reason science fiction and I are hit and miss with novels, horror is just my go-to!
