    <p>Haven’t had much to voice over the past few days.</p>
<p>Works been busy, had a mini vacation that work interrupted too much, and been trying to enjoy the nice weather we’ve had here in Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>
<p>Running outside is so much nicer than the treadmill.</p>
<p>I almost hit 6 miles on Sunday and it was awesome. I love being able to get lost in the journey, digest a podcast, and the whole experience feels effortless. Forgot to calibrate my watch though…. Want to try to get my pace down a bit, I’m targeting sub 10 min/mile for now.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 is hella fun.</p>
<p>This has been my go-to game the past few weeks and has provided a platform to reconnect with some of gaming friends.</p>
<p><strong>FOR DEMOCRACY</strong></p>
<p>I miss craft beer.</p>
<p>Just the experience of it, the social aspect, and the conversation. I’m still going strong on my sober-curious journey (almost 6 months), but it’s been a bit of a reset. Athletic Brewing still is a wonderful substitute.</p>
<p>That’s all I’ve got right now, time to run off to meeting….</p>
