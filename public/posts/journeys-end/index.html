    <p>This is a post, I never thought I would make&hellip;</p>
<p>Announcing the end of a 9+ year journey, the conclusion of &ldquo;What the Fluxtaposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucas and I set out to share our friendship and opinions on games and over time it evolved into so much more. Thank you for allowing us to share our lives with you all this time. I&rsquo;m happy that we always remained true to ourselves and never chased trends or modified our content to better fit into what would have been popular. Our show always remained true to itself, weird.</p>
<p>I never thought the show could last without Lucas, and Kevin was able to step in and fill that void. We soldiered on and I hope you got a laugh from his tales of triumph and failure. I had grand plans to push the show to new heights this year but as we have always joked on this show&hellip; life ugh&hellip;. finds a way. Truth be told, I&rsquo;m in a far different place than when this show first launched. My family life demands more of my attention and focus, coupled that with a really rewarding career and you don&rsquo;t have a lot of energy left at the end of the day to &ldquo;create&rdquo;. At least not if your heart is truly in it any longer. So in short, that&rsquo;s what has got us here&hellip; The end&hellip;</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s next? I&rsquo;m not sure yet. I want to take some time to just have a clean break and see what draws me. I&rsquo;d love to guest on a few random shows here and there and maybe look to develop &ldquo;Tuesdays With Fluxay&rdquo; into its own independent product. No timetable there, I&rsquo;ll set my own pace. As far as Fluxtaposed? The site will likely be taken down in the coming month along with the merch. I&rsquo;ll keep the feed up as long as Spotify allows and the Discord? That&rsquo;s not going anywhere. We&rsquo;ve always been a community, and I would like to keep it a community for as long as there are those willing to join us. If you need an invite, let me know!</p>
<p>Lastly, this show would have never ran as long as it did without YOU, the listeners. Thank you for your comments, your corrections, your support, and love all these yours. I look back fondly on the friendships and rivalries that kept us going as well as those early listeners that helped support the idea that this wasn&rsquo;t insane and people would actually listen to us. Again, thank you. Thank you Kevin, and thank you Tom for coming in and trying to right the ship. You did everything right, it was just me that eventually burned out. Lastly, my friend, Lucas Rose. This show would have never existed without you and your friendship. Life has definitely made it more difficult, but I hope we can get back to it soon.</p>
<p>Thank you Legion, thank you for everything. Maybe sometime this show can return reborn, but for now, it is time to say goodbye. Keep your passions, and keep being weird, you deserve it.</p>
<p>Much Love,</p>
<p>Jason &ldquo;hey fluxay&rdquo; Lacy</p>
<p>BUT WAIT</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just end like this!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more details on the final recording. Let&rsquo;s go out with a bang or an epic fail as only Fluxtaposed can provide!</p>
