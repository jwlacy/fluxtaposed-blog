    <p>My book holds got away from me…</p>
<p>I had two books due back in under 6 days, with still hundreds of pages to read in the first one.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, both books are finished! “Project Hail Mary” was up first. My first read by the author but very familiar with his work. It had a very intriguing setup but then felt a tad cliche yet safe if that makes sense. It was still an enjoyable read but it left me wanting just a little bit more.</p>
<p>“Dark Matter” on the other hand by Blake Crouch was utterly fantastic! Parallel universes/the multiverse and how realities can crash into one another was disastrous affects. The first chapter alone really hooks you and I knew I would have to devour every page. Two days later and I had it wrapped up and recommend it as well as stamp five stars on it. I’m definitely going to read more from this author and currently have book one in the Wayward Pines series on my hold list.</p>
<p>Next, it is time to continue the Expanse series with “Calaban’s War&quot;. Shout out to the <a href="https://bookrastinating.com/group/78/s/bookrastinators">Bookrastinators</a> for keeping us focused and rolling. I don’t think I would have discovered this series otherwise.</p>
