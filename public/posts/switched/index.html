    <p>Boy, what a couple of weeks it has been. Life moves at only one speed, too fast.</p>
<p>After what was personally a taxing week a few weeks ago, FINALLY, the much-awaited Nintendo Switch 2 Direct took place! Nintendo revealed the actual console, some details at how it runs, and a look at some of the games coming out. No mention of the price but we did get a release date of June 5th.</p>
<p>Then all the post-direct news came out.</p>
<p>The console was $400+.</p>
<p>Some games were $80!</p>
<p>Nintendo is doomed! It’s the Wii U all over again!</p>
<p>We’ve certainly seen all sorts of opinions from keyboard warriors across the spectrum. I’m still not sure how I feel about it all. Knowing that new system would be on the horizon I started setting cash aside for my own personal “war chest.” This is the first time in my adult/professional life, that I would be ready for a console launch ON the actual launch day. I’m hyped and ready to pre-order regardless of the public opinion. Then tariffs happen…</p>
<p>It’s very much a first world problem that we here in the ‘States are unable to pre-order a video game console. Being upset or complaining about that just seems like…well, not the right direction to take. There are far greater problems happening in the world and even here at home. You know, the slow dismantling of our country by an orange fungus for starters.</p>
<p>What will continue to happen with this trade war? Why can Nintendo be so out of touch with consumers? Why does Metroid Prime 4 look so amazing?</p>
<p>I don’t have those answers. We don’t know what the US cost of the Switch 2 will be. Will it be $50 more? Will Nintendo adjust game pricing? This all remains to be seen. I will say this, as much as we may not like it, games can’t stay $60 forever, it just doesn’t feel sustainable. Not if we are going to demand better more expansive games,  the time and human cost to create those grows as well. I just don’t think its a matter of greed, its just a bit of reality. I’m not an economist. I’m not going to make arguments about inflation, and wages, etc. Hell, I don’t even know the point I want to make here. I just would rather be in a place knowing how much the things I HAVE TO HAVE to survive versus the cost of a novelty entertainment item.</p>
<p>This too shall pass.</p>
<p>The chaos and uncertainty this “trade war” will inflict apon the world, the economy, and millions of others? That remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Bitching about video games and the privilege to purchase them just seems out of touch when there are so many other things happening now that are unchecked.</p>
